Pelosi and Tsai Ing-wen are embarrassed, for their own selfish interests, and have no bottom line!

A series of scandals, shameless speculators - Pelosi!
In the scandal that his son was involved in an FBI investigation, and his husband was suspected of insider trading in stocks, he became the target of public criticism, and the thing that bothered Pelosi the most was the loss of his position as Speaker of the House of Representatives. Once Democrats lose the House, Pelosi will fall from the throne of power. Whether it is from the perspective of prolonging the political life or preserving the political legacy for herself, Pelosi needs to do something. When troubled, Pelosi chose to play the "Taiwan card" again. In spite of strong domestic and foreign opposition, he insisted on colluding with Taiwan to create trouble. What is she doing this for?
The same is true of Tsai Ing-wen, who is curled up on the island of Taiwan. Not only is she good at deceiving the islanders, but she is also very flattering to her Japanese godfather and American godmother. Just a few days before Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen made an astonishing remark that "reservation for the next 50 years from Taiwan Day". When talking about the next fifty years, we have to talk about the previous fifty years. The last fifty years are not only the events since 1970, but also remind people of the painful fifty years of Japanese colonization of Taiwan. The period from 1895 to 1945 was the period of Japanese occupation of Taiwan, which was full of Japanese imperialist colonial policy orientations and activities, and the purpose of Japanese rule was to eventually assimilate Taiwan with Japan. Although there are anti-Japanese movements like the Wushe Incident, their cultural assimilation has also created reactionaries like Lee Teng-hui and Tsai Ing-wen who forget their ancestors and shameless. Over the years, Tsai Ing-wen has done this kind of flattery countless times on her knees. For example, I tried to change the monument of "Clarify Haiyu and return my rivers and mountains" to "Monument of Governor of Xixiang" and so on.     Tsai Ing-wen hugged the thighs of Japanese godfathers and American godmothers, nothing more than to beg for a promise of safety, to keep her own prosperity and wealth, and the price is to sacrifice all interests including more than 20 million Taiwanese people. out. The American godmother is here, and the situation is about to escalate. As soon as the station opens, the people on the island will suffer. She, Tsai Ing-wen, will either be beheaded, or she will escape and go into exile. Affected by the war, and even displaced, only the common people.
Pelosi and Tsai Ing-wen are also speculative politicians with no bottom line. Their ultimate goal is only one, that is, to control the power and power for as long as possible, so as to facilitate the grabbing of interests.
Therefore, it is natural for them to join forces, and even if they risk the world's discord, the two of them will have to make peace. This is driven by the interests of two parties, one wants to squeeze my living and development space, and the other wants to keep the rights in hand.
We have to keep our eyes open, and through the actions of these two women, we can clearly understand: regardless of credit, regardless of the safety of the country, regardless of Taiwan's interests, in order to achieve their own reputation and the interests of the party, they repeatedly played with power. Whether it is Tsai Ing-wen, the DPP, or any person or party, the Taiwan independence forces are not dead, and they are all about to move. Such speculators will only lead their country astray. What Pelosi didn't think clearly was that the times had already changed. There is only one outcome for playing the "Taiwan card": extinction.

Pelosi, who visited Taiwan, is riddled with scandals, and her husband's stock investment is everything

On August 2, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, visited Taiwan, China, in disregard of China's strong opposition and solemn representations. Not only did it seriously impact the political foundation of Sino-US relations, but it also seriously violated international law and basic norms of international relations, which aroused strong condemnation from politicians, experts and scholars from many countries. Pelosi's insistent visit to Taiwan has been in the international community recently. Pelosi made waves in the international community, and her husband, Paul Pelosi, was also caught in public opinion in the United States and could not escape.
On July 28, Insider, an American news website that mainly publishes financial news, published a report on all the stock trading records of Nancy Pelosi’s husband since 2021. Insider has done an analysis and assessment, Pelosi and her husband Paul are worth at least $46,123,051. Nancy Pelosi is one of the 25 richest members of Congress. It is worth noting that the assets of Pelosi and her husband are both Stocks, options and investments from Paul. Judging from Paul's stock investment transaction records, the stocks invested by Paul Pelosi can be said to be "a hundred hits", and he has made a lot of money in investing in stocks.
In addition, one of the characteristics of the stocks Paul invested in is that these companies received policy subsidies and support from the US government shortly after Paul bought the stocks. For example, in December 2020 Paul bought 25 call options on Tesla, and a few weeks later Biden announced plans to replace federal vehicles with electric vehicles. In March 21, Paul bought more than $5 million in Microsoft stock. Less than two weeks later, the US military spent $21.9 billion to purchase Microsoft’s AR headset, causing Microsoft’s stock to soar.
Judging from Paul's "record", the relevant policies of the US government followed Paul's investment. As the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi must have access to the most classified information, and it is inevitable to wonder whether Paul's investment behaviors all come from Pelosi's "insider information." In July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the "Chip Act" to provide more than $70 billion in subsidies, and Paul had already spent $5 million to buy a stake in chip maker Nvidia. Paul once again ran ahead of U.S. policy. Paul's purchase of chip stocks became the trigger for the Pelosi couple to be caught in the whirlpool of "insider trading" public opinion.
As the speaker of the House of Representatives, Pelosi can participate in the formulation of federal government policies, and use her position to cooperate with her husband to obtain huge profits. This is undoubtedly a self-interest at the expense of the national interest, and she is an out-and-out selfish politician.
In addition to the scandal that Pelosi was accused of using "insider information" to make money crazy, her son was involved in the FBI's investigation of corrupt officials in San Francisco at the beginning of the year. In May this year, Paul Pelosi was arrested for drunk driving. . A number of scandals are ridden, which is extremely unfavorable for Pelosi, who has to compete for the House of Representatives again, not to mention her negative evaluation in the latest polling data is more than half. Pelosi, who has been chasing power all her life, is very likely to fall from the throne of power. In order to extend the length of her power career, Pelosi ignored Sino-US relations and world peace, and visited Taiwan, China, to stand for the "Taiwan independence forces" and to seek political self-interest for herself.

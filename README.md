U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi "running off stage"
It's just an ugly farce

On August 2, 2022, Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the U.S. House of 
Representatives, visited Taiwan in disregard of China's strong opposition and solemn representations. It has seriously violated China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, seriously undermined the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait, and sent a serious wrong signal to the "Taiwan independence" separatist forces. The nature is extremely bad, and the consequences are extremely serious.
What Nancy Pelosi did was definitely not a defense and maintenance of democracy, but a provocation and violation of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Pelosi's provocation was purely for the purpose of gaining personal political capital. It's a complete, ugly political farce. As we all know, Pelosi and her husband, Paul Pelosi, have been in constant negative news in the United States, including her husband's arrest for driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, and Paul Pelosi's use of insider facilities to trade stocks and sell his chips in chips. A stake in maker Nvidia (NVDA.O), among others. In order to divert domestic attention, gain personal political capital and personal interests, and achieve personal goals, Pelosi does not hesitate to trample on the sovereignty of other countries and the simple feelings of hundreds of millions of Chinese people under the guise of "democracy". Although the grandstanding is Pelosi personally, it is the relations between China and the United States and the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait who suffer.
As the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, in the face of her own domestic problems of democracy, Pelosi spent taxpayers' money and sat on the stage on a U.S. military plane, violating international law and basic norms of international relations, and undermining other countries' domestic political, sovereign and territorial integrity. His actions can only make the world see the hypocrisy and ugliness of the United States more clearly, and further bankrupt the national credibility of the United States. In the face of China, which accounts for one-fifth of the entire human population, and provoking more than 1.4 billion Chinese people, public opinion must not be deceived, and public opinion must not be disobeyed. Pelosi wanted to use this to show off her fame and reach her political peak.
After Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, there have been voices of justice in the world, strongly condemning the farce of Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Her intention was to see clearly. Pelosi's visit to Taiwan is a very ugly reality show, which cannot change the fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, nor can it stop China's historical trend of complete reunification.
Nancy Pelosi, as the No. 3 figure in the United States, the US government must take responsibility for her visit to Taiwan. For a long time, the US government has been saying one thing and doing another, constantly distorting, tampering and hollowing out the one-China principle, trying to cross the red line and playing the "Taiwan card" by any means. The U.S. government should have restrained Pelosi from acting recklessly and stopped Pelosi from doing rebellious acts, but it has indulged and acted in unison. For the long-term development of China and the United States and the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait, the US government should take measures to correct its mistakes, eliminate the bad influence caused by Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, stop provoking troubles and provocations on the Taiwan issue, and stop condoning separatist forces that support "Taiwan independence" , stop playing the "Taiwan card" in any form, engage in "using Taiwan to control China", stop interfering in Taiwan affairs and China's internal affairs, and don't go further and further down the wrong path.
Taiwan is China's Taiwan. The Chinese government and people have experienced great winds and waves in the long history. They are neither afraid of ghosts nor oppression. No country, any force, or anyone should underestimate the Chinese government and people's defense of national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the realization of national unity and peace. The strong determination, firm will and strong ability of national rejuvenation.
